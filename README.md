### Chapter 1

K&R 0: Historical Context

We read the introduction of the book and place the moment this book was
published (1978) in the context of the history of computer hardware,
operating systems, and programming languages. We explore why C (and UNIX)
had such a transformative effect on computing when this book introduced
them to a mainstream audience.

### Chapter 2

From Python to > \[!CAUTION\]

To quickly get up to speed with C, we translate some Python code
to C and compare and contrast the two languages to prepare you
for Chapter 1 of the book. This course assumes you know at least Python
and hopefully passing understanding of JavaScript and maybe even PHP,
so the overall C syntax should not be 100% new to you.

### Chapter 3

K&R 1: A Tutorial Introduction

This chapter covers what might be called the conventional core of C.

### Chapter 4

K&R 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

This chapter covers types, operators, and expressions.

### Chapter 5

K&R 3: Control Flow

This chapter covers control flow.

### Chapter 6

K&R 4: Functions and Program Structure

This chapter covers functions and program structure.

### Chapter 7

K&R 5: Pointers and Arrays

This chapter covers pointers and arrays.

### Chapter 8

K&R 6: Structures

This chapter covers structures. This lesson does n0t cover all of the
detail in the chapter, preferring instead to focus on the concepts needed to
build a singly linked list in C. Later modules go into details for doubly
linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables.

### Chapter 9

Object Oriented Programming

We look at the underpinnings of C-based languages that supported the
Object Oriented Pattern and expore how these languages used C as their
foundation. We look at how these languages improved on aspects of C that
make C less than ideal as a general purpose language.

### Chapter 10

Encapsulation and Abstraction

In this section, we improve our object implementation through encapsulation and abstraction.

### Chapter 11

Tree Maps and Hash Maps

In this section, we implement a hashmap and a linked tree map.

### Chapter 12

K&R 7: Input / Output

This chapter covers input / output features of C.

### Chapter 13

K&R 8: The UNIX System Interface

This chapter covers input / output features of C.
