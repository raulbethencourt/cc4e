### Chapter 1

K&R 0: Historical Context

We read the introduction of the book and place the moment this book was
published (1978) in the context of the history of computer hardware,
operating systems, and programming languages. We explore why C (and UNIX)
had such a transformative effect on computing when this book introduced
them to a mainstream audience.

### Chapter 2

From Python to > \[!CAUTION\]

To quickly get up to speed with C, we translate some Python code
to C and compare and contrast the two languages to prepare you
for Chapter 1 of the book. This course assumes you know at least Python
and hopefully passing understanding of JavaScript and maybe even PHP,
so the overall C syntax should not be 100% new to you.
